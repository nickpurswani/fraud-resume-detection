# Fraud Resume Detection Tool - Recent Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements and fixes made to the Fraudulent Candidate Detection Tool to address various UI, functionality, and integration issues.

## 🎯 Summary of Improvements

### 1. Executive Summary Card Visibility Fix
**Issue**: Executive summary cards were transparent or not visible in the frontend
**Solution**: Enhanced CSS styling with improved visibility and visual appeal

#### Changes Made:
- Updated `.metric-container` CSS with white background and subtle shadows
- Added proper border styling with rounded corners
- Implemented color-coded risk indicators
- Enhanced typography and spacing
- Added responsive design elements

#### Before vs After:
```css
/* Before - Low visibility */
.metric-container {
    background-color: #f0f2f6;
    padding: 1rem;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    margin: 0.5rem 0;
}

/* After - Enhanced visibility */
.metric-container {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border: 2px solid #e1e8ed;
    padding: 1.2rem;
    border-radius: 0.8rem;
    margin: 0.5rem 0;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    text-align: center;
    min-height: 100px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### 2. Missing Analysis Tab Addition
**Issue**: NLP analysis results were not easily accessible in the UI
**Solution**: Added dedicated NLP Analysis tab to complement Gemini AI tab

#### New Features:
- **🔬 NLP Analysis Tab**: Displays detailed natural language processing results
- Personal information extraction summary
- Text statistics and quality metrics
- Language analysis and sentiment detection
- Skills and experience parsing results

### 3. Gemini AI Integration Fixes
**Issue**: Google Gemini API integration had import and configuration problems
**Solution**: Fixed API client initialization and import statements

#### Technical Fixes:
```python
# Fixed import for google-genai package
from google import genai

# Fixed client initialization
self.client = genai.Client(api_key=self.api_key)
```

### 4. Analysis Results Structure Improvements
**Issue**: Missing `fraud_score` and `risk_level` in top-level results
**Solution**: Added proper result mapping for easier access

#### Code Changes:
```python
# Added top-level fraud score and risk level for easier access
analysis_results['fraud_score'] = analysis_results['risk_assessment']['risk_score']
analysis_results['risk_level'] = analysis_results['risk_assessment']['overall_risk']
```

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
